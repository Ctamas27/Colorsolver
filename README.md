# Colorsolver
Bots purpose to make a perfect run on a color match game, there are 3 example pictures in the project that can help understand the game itself. 
There are 4 colors on the bottom that the user can move left or right, when a color goes out of bound then it appears on the opposite side.
Users job is to move the bottom part according to the falling blocks colors to make a match. The falling blocks are coming on 4 channels.
